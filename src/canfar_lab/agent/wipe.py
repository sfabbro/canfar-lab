"""Full factory-reset wipe of the agent layer (`agent wipe`).

Removes EVERY installed agent (binary + config + plugins + home dirs), the
``~/.astroai/lab`` setup state (stamps, locks, logs), and the Cursor agent
configs (skills / rules / mcp.json) so a user can restart from scratch.

Deliberately scoped: saved environments (~/.astroai/lab/saves/), preferences
(~/.astroai/lab/config.yaml), project files, and CANFAR client config are NOT
touched — only the agent-layer state (per-agent binaries/configs/plugins, the
setup stamp/failed/lock/log markers, Cursor configs, and the upstream-skill
cache) is removed.
